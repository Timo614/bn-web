                        of your employer), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and

                        for Organizers to create speaker profiles, organizer profiles, and other
                        webpages related to their events, promote those pages and events to
                        visitors or browsers on the Services or elsewhere online, manage online
                        or onsite ticketing and registration, solicit donations, and sell or
                        reserve merchandise or accommodations related to those events to
                        Consumers or other Users. Descriptions of other and more specific
                        services can generally be found on the Site of each of the BigNeon
                        Properties.

                        >2.2 How We Fit In. BigNeon is not the creator, organizer or owner of
                        the events listed on the Services. Rather, BigNeon provides its
                        Services, which allow Organizers to manage ticketing and registration
                        and promote their events. The Organizer is solely responsible for
                        ensuring that any page displaying an event on the Services (and the
                        event itself) meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and
                        other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services
                        described on the event page are delivered as described and in an
                        accurate satisfactory manner. The Organizer of a paid event selects the
                        payment processing method for its event as more fully described in the </span
                      ><span class="c6 c3">Merchant Agreement</span
                      ><span class="c3"
                        >. Consumers must use whatever payment processing method the Organizer
                        selects. If the Organizer selects a payment processing method that uses
                        a third party to process the payment, then neither BigNeon nor any of
                        its payment processing partners processes the transaction but we
                        transmit the Consumer&#39;s payment details to the Organizer&#39;s
                        designated payment provider. If an Organizer uses BigNeon Payment
                        Processing (as defined in the </span
                      ><span class="c6 c3">Merchant Agreement</span
                      ><span class="c2"
                        >), BigNeon also acts as the Organizer&#39;s limited agent solely for
                        the purpose of using our third party payment service providers to
                        collect payments made by Consumers on the Services and passing such
                        payments to the Organizer.</span

                        1-800-778-7879.) All issues in dispute between the parties are for the
                        arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to
                        the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 9.

                        arbitration hearings will take place (at your option) either in the
                        county of your residence or by phone, except that is you are a Consumer
                        whose residence is outside of the United States, the hearing will take
                        place either in Oakland, California or by phone or videoconference, at
                        your option and as permitted by the AAA Rules. If you are a business
                        (i.e., your use of the Services were for commercial use), then unless
                        BigNeon and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take
                        place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both
                        parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other
                        pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a
                        location, AAA will determine the location. If your claim is for ten
                        thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether
                        the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents
                        submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an
                        in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
                        ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be
                        determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                        arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written
                        decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on
                        which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator will be final
                        and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any
                        court having jurisdiction.

                        court proceeding, then BigNeon will pay the amount of any such costs and
                        expenses. In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the
                        claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule
                        of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse BigNeon for all such cost
                        and expenses that BigNeon paid and that you would have been obligated to
                        pay under the AAA rules.

                        will initially bear its own attorneys&#39; fees and expenses in
                        connection with any arbitration. Should either party be determined to
                        have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such
                        party&#39;s request, the arbitrator will award such prevailing party the
                        reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses that it incurred in
                        connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the
                        dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the
                        Services (rather than business use) BigNeon will not seek to recover its
                        attorneys&#39; fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you. The
                        arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement
                        of attorneys&#39; fees and expenses upon request from either party made
                        within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator&#39;s ruling on the merits.

                        to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice

                        Charge. Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services
                        are free. However, we charge fees when you sell or buy paid tickets or
                        registrations. These fees may vary based on individual agreements
                        between BigNeon and certain Organizers. Organizers ultimately determine
                        whether these fees will be passed along to Consumers and shown as
                        &quot;Fees&quot; on the applicable event page or absorbed into the
                        ticket or registration price and paid by the Organizer out of ticket and
                        registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Consumers may include
                        certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees,
                        royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfillment fees. Therefore, the
                        fees paid by Consumers for an event are not necessarily the same as
                        those charged by BigNeon to the applicable Organizer or the standard
                        fees described on the Services to Organizers. In addition, certain fees
                        are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by BigNeon, but
                        may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include
                        an element of loss. BigNeon does not control (and thus cannot disclose)
                        fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for
                        purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from
                        foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company
                        prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all applicable fees,
                        credit card surcharges and currency conversion rates.
